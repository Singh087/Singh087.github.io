            <p>
                During this assignment, I gained a deeper understanding of CSS concepts, including external stylesheets, internal styles, and inline styles.
                Implementing an external stylesheet and linking it to multiple HTML files has streamlined my workflow and made it easier to maintain consistent styles across my website.
                I also learned how to use internal styles to apply specific styles to individual HTML pages, providing more flexibility in design.
                Additionally, inline styles proved to be useful for quickly applying styles to specific elements without modifying external CSS files.
                Overall, this assignment has enhanced my CSS skills and provided valuable insights into efficient styling practices for web development.
