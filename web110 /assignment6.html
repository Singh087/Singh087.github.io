    <h1>Assignment 6- Summary</h1>
    <p>Activity 1: Review IP address settings for your local network
        I explored my local network's IP address configuration in this activity. I now have a better understanding of how IP addresses are allocated and controlled in a network environment thanks to my investigation. 
        I gained knowledge about IPv4 and IPv6, among other IP address types, as well as the value of DHCP and subnetting for effective network resource management.

        By utilising this knowledge in my present setting, I can make sure that my network is set up correctly for maximum security and performance. Through efficient assignment and management of IP addresses,
        I can troubleshoot connectivity problems and guarantee smooth communication between all devices on my network. This knowledge will come in very handy when I work with networks in the future and try to maximise their performance in different situations.

        Activity 2: Research plans available from different wired and wireless Internet providers
        I did research for this activity in order to compare the plans provided by different wired (like cable and DSL) and wireless (like cellular, wireless, and satellite) Internet providers. I learned about the various kinds of Internet connectivity options that are out there,
        as well as their benefits and drawbacks, through this process.
        
        By becoming aware of what each Internet provider has to offer, I can choose an Internet plan that best fits my needs and price range. Moreover, this understanding enables me to remain current with new developments and patterns in the Internet service provider sector. 
        With this knowledge in hand, I can select the best Internet plan for my house or place of business in my current setting, guaranteeing dependable connectivity for my daily tasks. This knowledge will be useful to me in the future as I attempt to stay connected in an increasingly digital world and navigate the constantly shifting landscape of Internet connectivity options.
