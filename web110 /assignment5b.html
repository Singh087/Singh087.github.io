    <h1>Assignment 5b- Summary</h1>
    <p>Activity: Complete TutorialsPoint: Internet Services
        After finishing the Internet Services Tutorial on TutorialsPoint, I studied the fundamental operations and protocols that support the wide range of services that are available on the Internet. 
        The course offered a perceptive examination of protocols including FTP, SMTP, and HTTP, clarifying their functions in enabling data transfer between networks.

        Through this project, I developed a deeper grasp of protocols and their importance in facilitating communication, collaboration, and information exchange.
        I also learnt about the nuances of data transfer and access online. I also understood the subtleties involved in debugging network problems and the significance of protocols in guaranteeing safe and effective data flow.

        By optimising different online tasks, I hope to apply the lessons learned from this activity to my current and future contexts. For example, mastering protocols such as SMTP can improve my capacity to efficiently handle email correspondence,
        guaranteeing prompt delivery and reply. Additionally, being familiar with FTP helps speed up file transfers, facilitating resource sharing and cooperation across various platforms and devices. Overall, the knowledge I've received from this exercise will enable me to more skillfully traverse the digital terrain,
        improving connectivity and productivity in both the personal and professional domains.
