    <h1>JavaScript Extra Credit Assignment</h1>
    <p>
        In this assignment, I learned how to work with x and y axis coordinates in JavaScript, and how to write text and draw shapes on a canvas. I also learned how to add event listeners to buttons and how to refresh a webpage using JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can apply this learning to my own current or future environment by using JavaScript to create interactive webpages and applications. For example, I can use JavaScript to create a webpage that displays data in real-time, or to create a game that responds to user input. I can also use JavaScript to create dynamic user interfaces that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
