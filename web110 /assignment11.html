    <h1>Web Accessibility Assignment 11</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Activity 1:</strong> I completed the "Web Accessibility: Overview and Principles" activity. This activity provided an overview of web accessibility and its importance in promoting equal access to information and services for all users, including those with disabilities. The activity covered the four principles of web accessibility, which are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. By incorporating these principles, web developers can create inclusive and accessible web content that can be easily accessed and used by everyone.

        <strong>Activity 2:</strong> I completed the "Web Accessibility: Creating Accessible Web Pages" activity. This activity focused on creating accessible web pages that can be easily accessed and used by all users, including those with disabilities. I learned about the importance of using semantic HTML elements, descriptive and meaningful text, and appropriate alternative text for images and multimedia. I also learned about the importance of using color and contrast appropriately, ensuring that web pages are navigable via a keyboard, and providing transcripts for multimedia content. By incorporating these best practices, web developers can create accessible web pages that meet the needs of all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
        <br><br>
        I envision being able to apply these concepts in my current and future environment by incorporating accessible web design principles and best practices in all web development projects that I undertake. By doing so, I can ensure that all web content is accessible and usable by all users, including those with disabilities. This will not only promote equal access to information and services but also ensure that web content is accessible to the widest possible audience.
