  <p>
    My final project idea is to create a web application that helps users track their daily tasks and goals. The application will have a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily add, edit, and delete tasks. It will also have a dashboard that displays the user's progress and provides reminders for upcoming deadlines. The application will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and will be hosted on GitHub Pages.

    Through this assignment, I learned how to create a Gantt chart in Excel and how to upload images to my GitHub repository using Visual Studio Code. I also learned how to write a clear and concise summary of my final project idea. These skills will be useful in my future projects, as they will allow me to effectively plan and communicate my ideas to others.
